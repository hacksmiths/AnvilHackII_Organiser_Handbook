# Registration

When on registration you will either be on the front desk or going back and forth from the RHB to the church.

If you are set to RHB you and one other will be taking turns taking attendees who end up at the RHB from the RHB to the church
One person must remain at the RHB to collect people who turn up and one going back and forth showing attendees where the church is hidden on campus.
We recommend you switch between each batch of people.
