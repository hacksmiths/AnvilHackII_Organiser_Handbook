# Forge Help

to be written by yuvesh in the morning


If you are on forge duty you must help set up the space for talks, fire at the forge etc.

for talks:
Make sure the chairs are tidy and neat and everyone is having a good time. Make sure you are visible so people can approach you if needed.

for the gig:
make sure people are having safe fun.
