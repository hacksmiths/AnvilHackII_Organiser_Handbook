# Code of Conduct

Our event is slightly different from other hacks, as we actually are following two codes of conduct.
-1. MLH Code of Conduct
-2. Goldsmiths Student Union Safe Space Policy

All attendees of Anvil Hack II are expected to abide by both of these and have agreed to them buy getting a ticket.The organizing team will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.
